Beyond Chronology, Using Bayesian Inference to Evaluate Hypotheses in Archaeology

This GitHub repository maintains the R Markdown, code, and data files necessary to replicate a pre-print of the manuscript titled "Beyond Chronology, Using Bayesian Inference to Evaluate Hypotheses in Archaeology", by Otarola-Castillo et al. accepted for publication in the journal Advances in Archaeological Practice. This document is not yet in press and as such it is currently evolving - slighly - the acknowledgments, for example are not yet complete; and Figure 2 remains in draft form. While these may seen cosmetic, however, all analyses, analytical and statistical discussions and arguments in the paper are in the accepted format and will remain in place.
